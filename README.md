### Learnt
You will learn how to use file resource as an object, in other words to parse lines and words from files using __edu.duke.FileResource__ 
further convert them into strings and do data analysis on them by storing them into __hashset__ for various purpose. One of the purpose might be counting frequency of words present in a file, in other words, __frequency Counter__ using 2 parallel __arrayList__ or a single __hashMap__.

Then you will learn __object oriented approach of looking at methods, instance variables and classes__.

Apart from that you will learn __for each loop__, how hashmap is faster than typical arrayList. Doing further task via taking multiple files at once using __edu.duke.DirectoryResource__.

### Setup
The BlueJ Environment download, documentation, and programming resources are available at: http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/index.php (Note that if you have already downloaded a version of BlueJ, you will need to uninstall and download this one to get the __edu.duke library__.) In addition, __BlueJ__ has provided a playlist of videos explaining some key Java terminology and how to use BlueJ.

On the Mac and Windows, BlueJ comes bundled with a Java Development Kit, JDK, so only a single download is needed.
